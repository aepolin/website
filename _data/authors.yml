    Hi, I'm Abigail Polin. I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist and a professor of physics and astronomy at Purdue Univserity. Before moving to Indiana I worked as a joint postdoctoral research fellow at Carnegie Observatories and Caltech in Pasadena, CA. I completed my PhD in 2020 at the University of Califonia, Berkeley, working with my thesis advisors Peter Nugent and Dan Kasen. 

    My research spans the area of astrophysical transients. I create hydrodynamical simulations to examine the theory behind astrophysical explosions, then perform radiative transport calculations to produce testable predictions that can be compared directly to observed data.

    Recently I was awarded the NERSC Early Career Award for High Impact Scientific Achievement for my work modeling the sub-Chandrasekhar mass pathway to Type Ia Supernovae. My recipient talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/up5favOwx7Q). 

    Follow this [link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/rnzPkOnNRQOugl8kwMgynA) for an up to date list of publications.

#    During graduate school I focused on sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf explosions as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. My thesis accurately predicted the observable properties associated with sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, which were later seen in SN2018byg, establishing the most direct evidence to date that there are multiple mechanisms through which white dwarfs explode.
