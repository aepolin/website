title: Thick He Shell Double Detonations
caption: When a double detonation is triggered by a thick helium shell a new type of transient occurs -- a Type I supernova with an early flux excess in its lightcurve and a heavily line blanketed spectrum. My modeled predictionswere used to help discover this new, growing, class of transients which currently has roughly 10 members.
description: >
  My thick shell double detonation model (purple) compared to the first discovered candidate of this class (SN 2018byg). Both model and supernova show an early flux excess in their light curves and a spectrum which is heavily line blanketed by the ashes of the burnt helium shell.
