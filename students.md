Here you can find the final symposium presentations of the undergraudate students I have mentored through the [Carnegie Astrophysics Summer Student Internship Program (CASSI)](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/carnegie-astrophysics-summer-student-internship-program-cassi). This summer internship program is designed to increase participation and retention of under-represented groups in astronomy. With CASSI we help our students to learn and get excited about an astronomy research with the goal of presenting their projects at AAS the winter after their experience.
