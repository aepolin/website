**Examining Type Ia Progenitor Channels Through C II Absorption Features**

Hayden worked on a data driven project during summer 2021. His aim was to identify which Type Ia supernovae in the Carnegie Supernova sample show signs of carbon Absorption features which would indicate they arise from the explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. He then compared the properties of these supernovae with other diagnositcs of Type Ia porgenitor channels.
