   I have experience teaching Physics and Astronomy, both as a sole course instructor and as a teaching assistant. From my past teaching experiences I have developed a teaching philosophy that can be summarized by the following tenets. First, students learn best through active participation and collaborative learning. Second, it is important for instructors to integrate technical skills such as computing and data analysis techniques throughout the curriculum. And third, physics is an inherently difficult subject and students shouldn't be expected to understand everything the first time they see it. Transparency as a teacher and a mentor is vital for student retention. In 2014 I was awarded UC Berkeley's **Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award** after being nominated for the honor by both my students and the Professors of record.
