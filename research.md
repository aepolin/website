    As a theoretical and computational astrophysicist, my research spans the gamut of astrophysical transients. I employ a combination of analytic, numerical and high-performance computing techniques to study the physics driving astrophysical explosions and I specialize in connecting that theory to observed transient phenomena. Specifically this looks like a coupling and expertise in both explosion modeling (performing hydrodynamic simulations with nuclear astrophysics in order to understand both the evolution and composition of these explosions), and radiative transport calculations (understanding the electromagnetic radiation of these events in order to produce synthetic lightcurves and spectra of the modeled events). In this manner, I use theory to produce testable predictions that can be compared directly to data.
