title: KITP Workshop on White Dwarfs from Physics to Astrophysics
caption: I discuss the explosive consequences of what can happen when a sub-Chadrasekhar mass White Dwarf is paired with a Helium Subdwarf as it's binary companion.
description: >
  A sub-Chandrasekhar mass White Dwarf and a Helium Subdwarf can lead to a new class of thermonulcear supernovae: that of a thick helium shell double detonation. This type of even was predicted in my paper [Observational Predictions for Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Explosions: Further Evidence for Multiple Progenitor Systems for Type Ia Supernovae](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873...84P/abstract) and later discoverd by ZTF: [SN2018byg: A Massive Helium-shell Double Detonation on a Sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873L..18D/abstract). We have now observed roughly 10 of these 18byg-like supernovae which match our modeled predictions, a number that is continually growing.
