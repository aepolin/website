title: Outreach
description: >
  I am passionate about giving back to my community and encouraging the next generation of scientists, as such I am always looking for outreach opportunities, whether that looks like public talks, going into classrooms or organizing community STEM activities. I am patricularly interested in activities that can reach a diverse audience as it is a well known issue that the demographics of scientists do not reflect the population of the world.
