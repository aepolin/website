title: Outreach
description: >
  I am passionate about giving back to my community and encouraging the next generation of scientists, as such I am always looking for outreach opportunities, whether that looks like public talks, going into classrooms or organizing community STEM activities. I am patricularly interested in opportunities that can reach a diverse audience as it is a well known issue that the demographics of scientists do not reflect the population of the world.

> **A Century of Distance Measures**
>
> 100 years ago Carnegie astronomer Edwin Hubble made a discovery from Mount Wilson that would change how we think of our place in the universe forever. The discovery of a variable star in the Andromeda galaxy allowed Hubble to establish conclusively that Andromeda is indeed a separate galaxy from the Milky Way. Join me as I discuss the history of astronomical distance measures, how we use them to map the universe, and open mysteries that puzzle us today.
