title: Introduction to Scientific Programming for Physics and Astronomy
caption: In 2020 I had the opportunity to design and teach my own course at UC Berkeley, Astro 9: Introduction to Scientific Computing for Physics and Astronomy. I intended this course to fill a gap in the undergraduate curriculum where no computing course was required for the undergraduate astronomy majors. The focus of the course was the application and implementation of practical computational techniques.

    The focus of the course was the application and implementation of practical computational techniques. My goal was that students leave with the computational fluency needed to participate in scientific research at the level of an undergraduate, e.g. at an NSF REU. Below is a description of my course and sylllabus if you are interested in staring such a course at your institution and would like to see more of my materials, please shoot me an email.
